1. Run state_analysis = true in rem section, preferably run rpa = 2 (for TDA the script works fine but the ordering becomes weird)
2. Run d_tildc.sh , this runs all the scripts and stores all the important values in a file {$input_file_name}_comp.txt
3  The elements in the _comp.txt file are printed in the order ->

| Excitation Energy | Oscillator Strength | Lambda | dcd | d_~cd | Gamma |
